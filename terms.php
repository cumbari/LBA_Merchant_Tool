  <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
  <div>
    <p><span>1.AGREEMENT</span></p>
    <p>The Cumbari Mobile Advertising Market Place  (&quot;Service&quot;), owned and operated by Cumbari AB (&quot;Cumbari&quot;),  a company incorporated under the laws of Germany, is provided to you  (&quot;Member&quot;, &quot;Advertiser&quot;, &quot;Publisher&quot;) under the  Terms and Conditions (&quot;Terms&quot;) of this Service Agreement  (&quot;Agreement&quot;), and any amendments thereto and any operating rules or  policies. Cumbari reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to change,  modify, add or remove all or part of the Agreement at any time. If any  modification to this agreement is unacceptable to you, your only recourse will  be to terminate this agreement. Your continued participation with the Service  following our posting of a new agreement on our site will constitute a binding  acceptance of the change. </p>
    <p>1.1 By accepting the Terms of the Agreement, the  Member (a) represents and warrants that s/he is of at least 18 years of age (b)  agrees to provide accurate, current and complete information about Member as  prompted by the Account Registration Form; and (c) agrees to maintain and  update this information to keep it accurate, current and complete. If any  information provided by Member is inaccurate, not current or incomplete, Cumbari  has the right to terminate Member's account. </p>
    <p>1.2 BY COMPLETING THE ACCOUNT REGISTRATION PROCESS,  AND CLICKING THE &quot;Register&quot; BUTTON, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE  AGREEMENT. If these Terms or any future changes are unacceptable to you, you  may cancel your account according to the Termination of Service. </p>
    <p><span>2. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE</span></p>
    <p>By completing Registration, Member creates an account  with the Service. Member accounts can function as both an Advertiser and/or  Publisher (&quot;Publisher&quot; and &quot;Advertiser&quot; respectively). The  dual role of the Service account gives the Member the ability to purchase  advertising by providing funds and selecting Publishers to display their ads on  the Publisher's mobile website for specified periods of time in an Advertiser  role, and/or promoting Advertiser ads on the Member's mobile website in a  Publishing role.</p>
    <p>2.1 Editorial Review - Cumbari will review each ad and  mobile website individually, and has the right to reject the Advertiser's ad or  mobile website for any reason. Upon passing the editorial review, the mobile  website will be allowed to run in the Service. </p>
    <p>2.2 Technical Support - Members may receive technical  help and resolve billing inquiries by contacting Cumbari Technical Support at  email <a href="mailto:Support@Widespace.com">Support@Cumbari.com</a> </p>
    <p>2.3 Neither this Agreement, nor any documentation  furnished under it is intended to express or imply any warranty that the  Service will be uninterrupted, timely or error-free. CUMBARI LIABILITY TO  MEMBER SHALL NOT, FOR ANY REASON, EXCEED THE AGGREGATE PAYMENTS ACTUALLY MADE  BY MEMBER TO THE SERVICE OVER THE COURSE OF THE EXISTING TERM. </p>
    <p>2.4 USE OF THE SERVICE SUBMISSIONS: By submitting  material or web page listings to the Service (including information regarding  the listing) you are irrevocably granting Cumbari, its licensees, and any  entities in the Service, the right to use all parts of the material without  limitation including, but not limited to, modifying it or using it commercially  and authorizing others to do so. Cumbari reserves the right to edit, refuse,  reject or remove any mobile website or ad at its discretion at any time from  the Service. </p>
    <p><span>3. MEMBER REPRESENTATIONS</span></p>
    <p>Member affirms that he is the legal owner of the URL  specified in his Advertiser account, an employee of the legal owner of the  domain, or has obtained express written permission from the legal owner of the  domain for use of the Service with the aforementioned domain. Member expressly  agrees to indemnify Cumbari from any claims by any third party arising from use  of the Advertiser Service with the specified URL. </p>
    <p><span>4. ADVERTISER FEES AND PUBLISHER PAYMENT</span></p>
    <p>If Member is an Advertiser, Member shall pre-pay all  applicable fees, as described in the Service, in connection with such Services  selected by Member. If Member is a Publisher, Member shall receive a percentage  of the &quot;Net Revenue&quot; of advertisements associated with Member's use  of the Service as solely determined by Cumbari. Net Revenue shall mean revenues  actually received by Cumbari from the sale of Advertisements displayed on  Publisher's mobile website less taxes. Publisher may in addition to online  transfer methods in the service, request payment by invoice. Advertiser  accounts feature an Auto-Renewal or &quot;rebill&quot; feature, which is  designed to ensure continuity of service. Auto-Renewal automatically funds  Member's Advertiser account from Member's credit card when Member's Advertiser  funds go below a certain user-defined amount. Any Member utilizing this feature  irrevocably grants their express permission for Cumbari to rebill their credit  card at the Advertiser's defined &quot;rebill&quot; interval. Cumbari reserves  the right to change payment dates, amounts, and service(s) at any time, with or  without prior notification to member, which may be posted on the Service  website, in Member's Service account, or emailed to Members. </p>
    <p>4.1 MINIMUM DEPOSIT: Service Member must have a &euro;25.00  fund balance in his/her Advertiser account. All funds maintained in Advertiser  account will be distributed equally among currently active ad campaigns to  ensure continuity of service. Cumbari reserves the right to reject any ad for  any reason. </p>
    <p><span>5. CLICK FRAUD</span></p>
    <p>All ad campaigns are closely monitored for fraudulent  activity by Cumbari. Publisher accounts believed to be responsible for  fraudulent clicks will be automatically restricted from use of their Publisher  area, and investigated for click fraud. Any revenue believed to be generated by  fraudulent clicks will be refunded to the Advertiser in good faith. CLICKING ON  YOUR OWN AD SPACE COUNTS AS CLICK FRAUD AND WILL RESULT IN AUTOMATIC  TERMINATION. Cumbari reserves the right to reject any or all requests for  investigation of assumed click fraud by any Member at their discretion. </p>
    <p><span>6. TERMINATION OF SERVICE</span></p>
    <p>Cumbari may terminate the Service with or without  cause at any time, effective immediately and without prior notice. Cumbari may  terminate a Member via written or email notice as necessary.

Should  Member object to any Terms of the Agreement or any subsequent modifications  hereto, or become dissatisfied with the Service in any way, the Member's sole  recourse is to immediately contact Cumbari support by emailing directly to  Support@Cumbari.com Upon termination of the Service, Member's right to use the  Service instantly ceases. Member shall have no right, and Cumbari shall have no  obligation thereafter, to forward any information associated with Member's  account. Any amount(s) paid for the month in which you cancel, and/or any  fee(s) for any month expired before your termination, is non-refundable. </p>
